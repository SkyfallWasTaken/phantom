## Features

### In-browser Python support

Phantom supports Python scripts - and they run in the browser!

This uses Pyodide under the hood. Pyodide is only loaded if you use the `python` command.

### Persistent filesystem

Phantom has a persistent filesystem (powered by IndexedDB), as well as commands to help you use it, such as `cd`, `cat`, `mkdir`, and `touch`.

### "Did You Mean?" suggestions

If you make a typo in a command, Phantom's got your back - it'll automatically provide a suggestion that may be relevant.

Under the hood, Phantom uses the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) to find the closest command in its registry.

### Pretty command prompt

Phantom has a cool command prompt, inspired by [Starship!](https://starship.rs)
